Comments about CORS.
====================

Apache is configured with
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://occweb.cfa.harvard.edu
and that prevents a development client running on my laptop, so I would normally need to add
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin http://localhost:3000

Cookies and CORS
----------------

I found this SO answer very useful:
(from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46288437/set-cookies-for-cross-origin-requests)

To allow receiving & sending cookies by a CORS request successfully, do the following.

Back-end (server): Set the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials value to true. Also, make sure the HTTP headers Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Headers are set and not with a wildcard *.

For more info on setting CORS in express js read the docs here

Cookie settings: Recommended Cookie settings per Chrome and Firefox update in 2021: SameSite=None and Secure. See MDN.

When doing SameSite=None, Secure is even required. See MDN.

Front-end (client): Set the XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials flag to true, this can be achieved in different ways depending on the request-response library used:

- jQuery 1.5.1 xhrFields: {withCredentials: true}
- ES6 fetch() credentials: 'include'
- axios: withCredentials: true

Configuring Flask CORS
----------------------

A quick way to configure it is something like

    app.config['CORS_ORIGINS'] = ["http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
    app.config['CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS'] = ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
    app.config['CORS_SEND_WILDCARD'] = True
    app.config['CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS'] = ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
